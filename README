This is just a fix for the stairs of the Payday 2 map called "All Ghillied up".
All rights belong to the author: https://modworkshop.net/mod/29297

Tip: Because of the way in which the map was made, the only way to play it is to turn the video options off completely.
Meaning - everything set to the lowest possible setting/option and everything else turned off

Most of the mods don't seem to cause an issue.
Enjoy.
